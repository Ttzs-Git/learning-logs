# my C language learning 
#### introduce
Here are my C language learning notes and code package. The repository contains: the code during the study, the notes organized during the study, the algorithm problem practice after the study, and so on

#### Software architecture
This section contains the following:
- 1. C learning code area (including: code and comments, as well as possible static link libraries and dynamic link libraries, collated notes, etc.);
- 2. Algorithm code area (including: the source of the problem, the solution of the problem and my immature solution, etc.);
- 3. Notes and blog area (including: sorted notes and code);
- 4. Small project area (including: C language programs and interesting projects generated by some immature ideas);
#### Directions for use
- 1. Start by downloading the content of the notes and blog area for holistic language learning and macro perception
- 2. Practice the code, open any suitable IDE, and copy the code in the notes area and code area
- 3. If there is a problem with the code, download the code area code for comparison
- 4. When the content of the code area is practiced, the algorithm question area or small project area is reproduced, adapted, and surpassed
#### statement
If you find that a problem in a certain area should have a better solution to be completed, or my notes and code are wrong, please correct it through **My Email**, I will reply within 3 working days, and please indicate your intention; Everyone who loves C language is also welcome to join in.
Our goal is to learn C well and lay a solid foundation.
Major updates in the freshman year, i.e., between September 2024 and January 2025;
Bigger, updated from time to time
