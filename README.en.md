#### Introduction

This repository is used to record the journey of my exploration of the magical computer world, from the bitter C language, the difficult high math and line algebra, to the concise python and the more diverse C++, to the endless computer knowledge and mathematical knowledge

The rat's storm exposure to computers and higher education began in the first year of college, so I hope the bigwigs will give more advice

Knowledge is infinite, and it is also interesting, may I always indulge in the ocean of knowledge :eyes::eyes::eyes:
