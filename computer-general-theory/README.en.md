# Computer General Theory

#### Introduction

As a computer newbie, it is very suitable for the setting of "knowing how to play computers, but not understanding the principles of computers at all". Therefore, I created this repository to record my acquired computer knowledge, including but not limited to: commonly used computer tools, new computer directions, an overview of computers, and so on. And I don't have the ability to handle truly difficult professional courses yet. However, it won't be too long. The world of computers is really exciting, welcome everyone to join!!!
